Please don't skip this 1-minute read. I'm sorry to interrupt, but our fundraiser won’t last long. This Saturday, 2 September, I humbly request you to reflect on the number of times you visited Wikipedia in the past year, the value you got from it, and whether you're able to contribute ₹ 25. If you can, kindly join the 2% of readers who donate. If everyone reading this right now gave ₹ 25, we'd reach our goal in a couple of hours.

When I set up the Wikimedia Foundation as a nonprofit to host Wikipedia and 12 other free knowledge projects, it meant that we could preserve our core values: neutral, high quality information, not outrage and sensationalism. Being a nonprofit means there is no danger that someone will buy Wikipedia and turn it into their personal space.

If Wikipedia has given you ₹ 25 worth of knowledge this year, kindly donate now, it really matters. Thank you for your
